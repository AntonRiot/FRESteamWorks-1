# Basic AIR native extension to SteamWorks API #

It's using appId 480, which is example application from the Steamworks SDK. Somehow is not possible to write to cloud with this appId, but it's working with our real one.
It's everything what we need at this moment, but there are more functions to play with in the SteamWorks SDK. I'm not sure how legal it is to include the Steam libs and headers so these are not included. You can get them at this web https://partner.steamgames.com
